# ERC-20 TOKEN LAUNCH CONTRACT
---------------------------------------

A secure and production-ready ERC-20 token built with Solidity, OpenZeppelin, and Hardhat.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a token launch including:

Smart contract development
Automated testing
Deployment scripting
Security best practices

The repository represents the foundation of an ERC-20 Token Launch package, which can be expanded with additional Web3 infrastructure such as crowdsales, vesting contracts, staking systems, and DAO governance.


PROJECT GOALS 
---------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a modern ERC-20 token should be designed for real-world use.

The contract includes common features required by token launches:

Controlled token minting
Maximum supply limits
Emergency pause capability
Token burning
Role-based administrative permissions
Event logging for transparency

These patterns are widely used in production Web3 applications.


SMART CONTRACT FEATURES
---------------------------------------
FIXED MAXIMUM SUPPLY
The contract enforces a hard cap on the total supply using OpenZeppelin's ERC20Capped.
This prevents tokens from being minted beyond the maximum supply.

INITIAL TOKEN MINT
When the contract is deployed, an initial supply of tokens is minted directly to the deployer.

ROLE-BASED PERMISSIONS
Administrative actions are protected using OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl.
Roles include:

Role	Description
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE	Can manage roles
MINTER_ROLE	Allowed to mint tokens
PAUSER_ROLE	Allowed to pause/unpause transfers

MINTING
Authorized accounts with the MINTER_ROLE can mint new tokens up to the cap.
Every mint emits a TokensMinted event.

BURNING
Any token holder can permanently destroy tokens from their own balance using the burn function.
Each burn emits a TokensBurned event.

EMERGENCY PAUSE
Authorized accounts with the PAUSER_ROLE can pause all token transfers.
This is useful if a vulnerability or emergency occurs.
Transfers resume when the contract is unpaused.

EVENT TRACKING
The contract emits events for important actions:

TokensMinted
TokensBurned
TokenPaused
TokenUnpaused

Events make it easier for applications, dashboards, and explorers to monitor contract activity.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
---------------------------------------

This project was built using the following tools:

Solidity – Smart contract programming language
Hardhat – Ethereum development environment
Ethers.js – Contract interaction library
OpenZeppelin Contracts – Secure smart contract libraries
Mocha & Chai – JavaScript testing framework
Alchemy – Ethereum RPC provider
Sepolia Test Network – Deployment environment

PROJECT STRUCTURE
---------------------------------------

    SampleToken.sol

scripts/
    deploy.js

contracts
Contains the ERC-20 smart contract implementation.

scripts
Contains the deployment script used to deploy the token.

test
Contains automated tests verifying all major contract behaviors.

SMART CONTRACT ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------------

The SampleToken contract extends several OpenZeppelin modules:

ERC20
ERC20Burnable
ERC20Capped
ERC20Pausable
AccessControl

This modular architecture provides strong security and reusable functionality while keeping the contract easy to audit.

INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------

CLONE THE REPOSITORY:

git clone https://github.com/Ktredway0128/erc20-token-launch

cd erc20-token-launch

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:

npm install

COMPLE THE CONTRACT:

npx hardhat compile

RUN THE TEST SUITE :

npx hardhat test

THE TESTS VALIDATE:

Token initialization
Transfers
Mint permissions
Pause / unpause functionality
Token burning
Supply cap enforcement
Role-based access control

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
---------------------------------------

Create a .env file in the root directory.

ALCHEMY_API_URL=YOUR_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

These values allow Hardhat to:

Connect to the Sepolia network
Sign transactions using the deployer's wallet

DEPLOYMENT
---------------------------------------

To deploy the contract to Sepolia:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

The deployment script performs the following steps:

Retrieves the deployer wallet
Creates the contract factory
Deploys the token with constructor parameters
Waits for confirmation
Outputs the deployed contract address

EXAMPLE TOKEN CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------

Example parameters used in deployment:

Token Name: Sample Token
Token Symbol: STK
Maximum Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
Initial Supply: 100,000 tokens


SECURITY PRACTICES
---------------------------------------

The contract uses well-established patterns from OpenZeppelin including:

Supply caps
Role-based permissions
Emergency pause mechanisms
Audited contract libraries

These are common practices used in production smart contracts.

EXAMPLE USE CASES
---------------------------------------

This ERC-20 architecture can support many types of projects:

DAO governance tokens
Startup utility tokens
Game economies
Loyalty rewards
DeFi protocol tokens

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
---------------------------------------

This project serves as the base layer for a larger Web3 infrastructure package.

Possible upgrades include:

Token crowdsale contracts
Investor vesting schedules
Staking rewards
Governance (DAO voting)
Treasury management
Upgradeable proxy contracts
